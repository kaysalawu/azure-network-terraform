## Overview

Deploy a single-region Hub and Spoke Secured Virtual Network (Vnet) topology using the [Azure Virtual Network Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network-manager/concept-connectivity-configuration#hub-and-spoke-topology) (AVNM) service. Learn about traffic routing patterns, [hybrid DNS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-resolver-hybrid-dns) resolution, firewall security policies, and [PrivateLink Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview) access to IaaS, [PrivateLink](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-overview) access to PaaS services.

![Secured Hub and Spoke (Single region)](../../images/scenarios/3-1-hub-spoke-nm-azfw-single-region.png)

***Hub1*** is a Vnet hub that has an Azure firewall used for inspection of traffic between an on-premises branch and Vnet spokes. User-Defined Routes (UDR) are used to influence the hub Vnet data plane to route traffic between the branch and spokes via the firewall. An isolated spoke ***spoke3*** does not have Vnet peering to ***hub1***, but is reachable from the hub via [Private Link Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview). AVNM is used to create a hub and spoke topology that connects ***spoke1*** and ***spoke2*** to ***hub1***. The spokes are not directly connected to each other but use the hub Azure firewall for inter-spoke traffic.

***Branch1*** is our on-premises network simulated in a Vnet. A Multi-NIC Cisco-CSR-1000V Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) connects to the ***hub1*** using an IPsec VPN connection with dynamic (BGP) routing.

## Testing

Each virtual machine is pre-configured with a shell [script](../../scripts/server.sh) to run various types of network reachability tests. Serial console access has been configured for all virtual machines. You can [access the serial console](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/serial-console-overview#access-serial-console-for-virtual-machines-via-azure-portal) of a virtual machine from the Azure portal.

Login to virtual machine `Ne32-spoke1-vm` via the serial console:

- On Azure portal select *Virtual machines*
- Select the virtual machine `Ne32-spoke1-vm`
- Under ***Help*** section, select ***Serial console*** and wait for a login prompt
- Enter the login credentials
  - username = ***azureuser***
  - password = ***Password123***
- You should now be in a shell session `azureuser@Ne32-spoke1-vm:~$`

Run the following tests from inside the serial console session.

### 1. Ping IP

This script pings the IP addresses of some test virtual machines and reports reachability and round trip time.

**1.1.** Run the IP ping test

```sh
ping-ip
```

Sample output

```sh
azureuser@Ne31-spoke1-vm:~$ ping-ip

 ping ip ...

branch1 - 10.10.0.5 -OK 6.275 ms
hub1    - 10.11.0.5 -OK 5.093 ms
spoke1  - 10.1.0.5 -OK 0.038 ms
spoke2  - 10.2.0.5 -OK 3.841 ms
internet - icanhazip.com -NA
```

### 2. Ping DNS

This script pings the DNS name of some test virtual machines and reports reachability and round trip time. This tests hybrid DNS resolution between on-premises and Azure.

**2.1.** Run the DNS ping test

```sh
ping-dns
```

Sample output

```sh
azureuser@Ne31-spoke1-vm:~$ ping-dns

 ping dns ...

vm.branch1.corp - 10.10.0.5 -OK 6.815 ms
vm.hub1.az.corp - 10.11.0.5 -OK 4.633 ms
vm.spoke1.az.corp - 10.1.0.5 -OK 0.035 ms
vm.spoke2.az.corp - 10.2.0.5 -OK 3.847 ms
icanhazip.com - 104.18.115.97 -NA
```

### 3. Curl DNS

This script uses curl to check reachability of web server (python Flask) on the test virtual machines. It reports HTTP response message, round trip time and IP address.

**3.1.** Run the DNS curl test

```sh
curl-dns
```

Sample output

```sh
azureuser@Ne31-spoke1-vm:~$ curl-dns

 curl dns ...

200 (0.070670s) - 10.10.0.5 - vm.branch1.corp
200 (0.024667s) - 10.11.0.5 - vm.hub1.az.corp
200 (0.020426s) - 10.11.4.4 - spoke3.p.hub1.az.corp
[14202.663678] cloud-init[1637]: 10.1.0.5 - - [18/Nov/2023 18:22:45] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
200 (0.018974s) - 10.1.0.5 - vm.spoke1.az.corp
200 (0.045537s) - 10.2.0.5 - vm.spoke2.az.corp
000 (2.000944s) -  - vm.spoke3.az.corp
200 (0.044211s) - 104.18.114.97 - icanhazip.com
```

We can see that curl test to spoke3 virtual machine `vm.spoke3.az.corp` returns a ***000*** HTTP response code. This is expected since there is no Vnet peering from ***spoke3*** to ***hub1***. However, ***spoke3*** web application is reachable via Private Link Service private endpoint in ***hub1*** `spoke3.p.hub1.az.corp`.

### 4. Private Link Service

Test access to `Spoke3` application using the private endpoint in `Hub1`.

```sh
curl spoke3.p.hub1.az.corp
```

Sample output

```sh
azureuser@Ne31-spoke1-vm:~$ curl spoke3.p.hub1.az.corp
{
  "Headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Host": "spoke3.p.hub1.az.corp",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.68.0"
  },
  "Hostname": "Hs11-spoke3-vm",
  "Local-IP": "10.3.0.5",
  "Remote-IP": "10.3.3.4"
}
```

The `Hostname` and `Local-IP` fields belong to the servers running the web application - in this case `Spoke3` virtual machine. The `Remote-IP` field (as seen by the web servers) is an IP addresses in the Private Link Service NAT subnet.

### 5. Private Link (App Service) Access from Public Client

An app service instance is deployed for ***spoke3***. The app service instance is a fully managed PaaS service. In this lab, the service is linked to ***spoke3***. By using [Virtual Network integration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-vnet-integration#regional-virtual-network-integration), the app service is deployed in a dedicated ***AppServiceSubnet*** subnet in ***spoke3***. This allows the app service to access private resources in ***spoke3*** Vnet.

The app service is accessible via the private endpoint in ***hub1***. The app service is also accessible via its public endpoint. The app service application is a simple [python Flask web application](https://hub.docker.com/r/ksalawu/web) that returns the HTTP headers, hostname and IP addresses of the server running the application.

The app service uses the following naming convention:

- ne31-spoke3-AAAA-app.azurewebsites.net

Where ***AAAA*** is a randomly generated two-byte string.

**5.1.** On your local machine, get the hostname of the app service linked to ***spoke3***

```sh
spoke3_apps_url=$(az webapp list --resource-group Ne31RG --query "[?contains(name, 'ne31-spoke3')].defaultHostName" -o tsv)
```

**5.2.** Display the hostname

```sh
echo $spoke3_apps_url
```

Sample output (yours will be different)

```sh
ne31-spoke3-b8b6-app.azurewebsites.net
```

**5.3.** Resolve the hostname

```sh
nslookup $spoke3_apps_url
```

Sample output (yours will be different)

```sh
1-hub-spoke-azfw-single-region$ nslookup $spoke3_apps_url
Server:         172.19.144.1
Address:        172.19.144.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
ne31-spoke3-b8b6-app.azurewebsites.net  canonical name = ne31-spoke3-b8b6-app.privatelink.azurewebsites.net.
ne31-spoke3-b8b6-app.privatelink.azurewebsites.net      canonical name = waws-prod-am2-361.sip.azurewebsites.windows.net.
waws-prod-am2-361.sip.azurewebsites.windows.net canonical name = waws-prod-am2-361-3d79.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com.
Name:   waws-prod-am2-361-3d79.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com
Address: 20.50.2.18
```

We can see that the endpoint is a public IP address, ***20.50.2.18***. We can see the CNAME `ne31-spoke3-b8b6-app.privatelink.azurewebsites.net` created for the app service which recursively resolves to the public IP address.

**5.4.** Test access to the ***spoke3*** app service via the public endpoint.

```sh
curl $spoke3_apps_url
```

Sample output

```sh
1-hub-spoke-azfw-single-region$ curl $spoke3_apps_url
{
  "Headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Client-Ip": "152.37.70.253:2074",
    "Disguised-Host": "ne31-spoke3-b8b6-app.azurewebsites.net",
    "Host": "ne31-spoke3-b8b6-app.azurewebsites.net",
    "Max-Forwards": "10",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.74.0",
    "Was-Default-Hostname": "ne31-spoke3-b8b6-app.azurewebsites.net",
    "X-Arr-Log-Id": "875e23f8-a2f3-422b-8fdf-4ca36f85d5b8",
    "X-Client-Ip": "152.37.70.253",
    "X-Client-Port": "2074",
    "X-Forwarded-For": "152.37.70.253:2074",
    "X-Original-Url": "/",
    "X-Site-Deployment-Id": "ne31-spoke3-b8b6-app",
    "X-Waws-Unencoded-Url": "/"
  },
  "Hostname": "c724731ba367",
  "Local-IP": "169.254.129.3",
  "Remote-IP": "169.254.129.1"
}
```

Observe that we are connecting from our local client's public IP address (174.173.70.196) specified in the `X-Client-Ip`.

Let's confirm the public IP address of our local machine

```sh
curl -4 icanhazip.com
```

Sample output (yours will be different)

```sh
$ curl -4 icanhazip.com
152.37.70.253
```

**(Optional)** Repeat *Step 5.1* through *Step 5.4* for the app service linked to ***spoke6***.

### 6. Private Link (App Service) Access from On-premises

**6.1** Recall the hostname of the app service in ***spoke3*** as done in *Step 5.2*. In this lab deployment, the hostname is `ne31-spoke3-b8b6-app.azurewebsites.net`.

**6.2.** Connect to the on-premises server `Ne31-branch1-vm` [using the serial console](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/serial-console-overview#access-serial-console-for-virtual-machines-via-azure-portal). We will test access from `Ne31-branch1-vm` to the app service for ***spoke3*** via the private endpoint in ***hub1***.

**6.3.** Resolve the hostname DNS - which is `ne31-spoke3-b8b6-app.azurewebsites.net` in this example. Use your actual hostname from *Step 6.1*.

```sh
nslookup ne31-spoke3-<AAAA>-app.azurewebsites.net
```

Sample output

```sh
azureuser@Ne31-branch1-vm:~$ nslookup ne31-spoke3-b8b6-app.azurewebsites.net
Server:         127.0.0.53
Address:        127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
ne31-spoke3-b8b6-app.azurewebsites.net  canonical name = ne31-spoke3-b8b6-app.privatelink.azurewebsites.net.
Name:   ne31-spoke3-b8b6-app.privatelink.azurewebsites.net
Address: 10.11.4.5
```

We can see that the app service hostname resolves to the private endpoint ***10.11.4.5*** in ***hub1***. The following is a summary of the DNS resolution from `Ne31-branch1-vm`:

- On-premises server `Ne31-branch1-vm` makes a DNS request for `ne31-spoke3-b8b6-app.azurewebsites.net`
- The request is received by on-premises DNS server `Ne31-branch1-dns`
- The DNS server resolves `ne31-spoke3-b8b6-app.azurewebsites.net` to the CNAME `ne31-spoke3-b8b6-app.privatelink.azurewebsites.net`
- The DNS server has a conditional DNS forwarding defined in the [unbound DNS configuration file](./output/branch-unbound.sh).

  ```sh
  forward-zone:
          name: "privatelink.azurewebsites.net."
          forward-addr: 10.11.5.4
  ```

  DNS Requests matching `privatelink.azurewebsites.net` will be forwarded to the private DNS resolver inbound endpoint in ***hub1*** (10.11.5.4).
- The DNS server forwards the DNS request to the private DNS resolver inbound endpoint in ***hub1*** - which returns the IP address of the app service private endpoint in ***hub1*** (10.11.4.5)

**6.4.** From `Ne31-branch1-vm`, test access to the ***spoke3*** app service via the private endpoint. Use your actual hostname.

```sh
curl ne31-spoke3-<AAAA>-app.azurewebsites.net
```

Sample output

```sh
azureuser@Ne31-branch1-vm:~$ curl ne31-spoke3-b8b6-app.azurewebsites.net
{
  "Headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Client-Ip": "[fd40:7a3:12:a7f3:7b12:700:a0a:5]:51252",
    "Disguised-Host": "ne31-spoke3-b8b6-app.azurewebsites.net",
    "Host": "ne31-spoke3-b8b6-app.azurewebsites.net",
    "Max-Forwards": "10",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.68.0",
    "Was-Default-Hostname": "ne31-spoke3-b8b6-app.azurewebsites.net",
    "X-Arr-Log-Id": "2c4d9fe3-fd10-43bc-85b6-418aa842b4cd",
    "X-Client-Ip": "10.10.0.5",
    "X-Client-Port": "0",
    "X-Forwarded-For": "10.10.0.5",
    "X-Original-Url": "/",
    "X-Site-Deployment-Id": "ne31-spoke3-b8b6-app",
    "X-Waws-Unencoded-Url": "/"
  },
  "Hostname": "c724731ba367",
  "Local-IP": "169.254.129.3",
  "Remote-IP": "169.254.129.1"
}
```

Observe that we are connecting from the private IP address of `Ne31-branch1-vm` (10.10.0.5) specified in the `X-Client-Ip`.

### 7. Onprem Routes

Login to the onprem router `Ne31-branch1-nva` and observe its dynamic routes.

**7.1.** Login to virtual machine `Ne31-branch1-nva` via the [serial console](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/serial-console-overview#access-serial-console-for-virtual-machines-via-azure-portal).

**7.2.** Enter username and password

   - username = ***azureuser***
   - password = ***Password123***

**7.3.** Enter the Cisco enable mode

```sh
enable
```

**7.4.** Display the routing table by typing `show ip route` and pressing the space bar to show the complete output.

```sh
show ip route
```

Sample output

```sh
Ne31-branch1-nva-vm#show ip route
...

We can see our hub and spoke Vnet ranges are learned dynamically via BGP.

**7.5.** Display BGP information by typing `show ip bgp`.

```sh
show ip bgp

```

We can see our hub and spoke Vnet ranges being learned dynamically in the BGP table.

### 8. Azure Firewall

**8.1.** Check the Azure Firewall logs to observe the traffic flow.

- Select the Azure Firewall resource `Ne31-hub1-azfw` in the Azure portal.
- Click on **Logs** in the left navigation pane.
- Click **Run** in the *Network rule log data* log category.

![Ne31-hub1-azfw-network-rule-log](../../images/demos/ne31-hub1-net-rule-log.png)

Observe the firewall logs based on traffic flows generated from our tests.

## Cleanup

1. (Optional) Navigate back to the lab directory (if you are not already there)

   ```sh
   cd azure-network-terraform/3-network-manager/1-hub-spoke-azfw-single-region
   ```

2. Run a cleanup script to remove some resources that may not be removed after the resource group deletion.

   ```sh
   bash ../../scripts/_cleanup.sh Ne31RG
   ```

   Sample output

   ```sh
   1-hub-spoke-azfw-single-region$ bash ../../scripts/_cleanup.sh Ne31RG

   Resource group: Ne31RG

   Deleting: diag setting [Ne31-hub1-azfw-diag] for firewall [Ne31-hub1-azfw] ...
   Deletion complete!
   ```

3. Delete the resource group to remove all resources installed.

   ```sh
   az group delete -g Ne31RG --no-wait
   ```
