## Overview

This lab deploys a single-region Hub and Spoke Secured Virtual Network (Vnet) topology using Azure Firewall for traffic inspection. The lab demonstrates traffic routing patterns, [hybrid DNS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-resolver-hybrid-dns) resolution, firewall security policies, and [PrivateLink Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview) access to IaaS, [PrivateLink](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-overview) access to PaaS services.

***Hub1*** is a Vnet hub that has an Azure firewall used for inspection of traffic between an on-premises branch and Vnet spokes. User-Defined Routes (UDR) are used to influence the hub Vnet data plane to route traffic between the branch and spokes via the firewall. An isolated spoke ***spoke3*** does not have Vnet peering to ***hub1***, but is reachable from the hub via [Private Link Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview).

***Branch1*** is our on-premises network simulated in a Vnet. A Multi-NIC Linux Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) connects to the ***hub1*** using an IPsec VPN connection with dynamic (BGP) routing.

## Prerequisites

## Testing

Each virtual machine is pre-configured with a shell [script](../../scripts/server.sh) to run various types of network reachability tests. Serial console access has been configured for all virtual machines.

Login to virtual machine `Hs11-spoke1Vm` via the [serial console](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/serial-console-overview#access-serial-console-for-virtual-machines-via-azure-portal):

- On Azure portal select *Virtual machines*
- Select the virtual machine `Hs11-spoke1Vm`
- Under ***Help*** section, select ***Serial console*** and wait for a login prompt
- Enter the login credentials
  - username = ***azureuser***
  - password = ***Password123***
- You should now be in a shell session `azureuser@Hs11-spoke1Vm:~$`

Run the following tests from inside the serial console session.

### 1. Ping IP

This script pings the IP addresses of some test virtual machines and reports reachability and round trip time.

**1.1.** Run the IP ping test

```sh
ping-ip
```

<details>

<summary>Sample output</summary>

```sh
azureuser@spoke1Vm:~$ ping-ip

 ping ip ...

branch1 - 10.10.0.5 -OK 4.260 ms
hub1    - 10.11.0.5 -OK 2.523 ms
spoke1  - 10.1.0.5 -OK 0.032 ms
spoke2  - 10.2.0.5 -OK 2.730 ms
internet - icanhazip.com -NA
```

</details>
<p>

### 2. Ping DNS

This script pings the DNS name of some test virtual machines and reports reachability and round trip time. This tests hybrid DNS resolution between on-premises and Azure.

**2.1.** Run the DNS ping test

```sh
ping-dns
```

<details>

<summary>Sample output</summary>

```sh
azureuser@spoke1Vm:~$ ping-dns

 ping dns ...

branch1vm.corp - 10.10.0.5 -OK 9.347 ms
hub1vm.eu.az.corp - 10.11.0.5 -OK 3.250 ms
spoke1vm.eu.az.corp - 10.1.0.5 -OK 0.025 ms
spoke2vm.eu.az.corp - 10.2.0.5 -OK 2.389 ms
icanhazip.com - 104.16.185.241 -NA
```

</details>
<p>

### 3. Curl DNS

This script uses curl to check reachability of web server (python Flask) on the test virtual machines. It reports HTTP response message, round trip time and IP address.

**3.1.** Run the DNS curl test

```sh
curl-dns
```

<details>

<summary>Sample output</summary>

```sh
azureuser@spoke1Vm:~$ curl-dns

 curl dns ...

200 (0.041092s) - 10.10.0.5 - branch1vm.corp
200 (0.019036s) - 10.11.0.5 - hub1vm.eu.az.corp
200 (0.028015s) - 10.11.7.88 - spoke3pls.eu.az.corp
200 (0.008495s) - 10.1.0.5 - spoke1vm.eu.az.corp
200 (0.021749s) - 10.2.0.5 - spoke2vm.eu.az.corp
200 (0.015688s) - 104.16.184.241 - icanhazip.com
200 (0.023444s) - 10.11.7.99 - https://hs11spoke3sa4dd5.blob.core.windows.net/spoke3/spoke3.txt
```

</details>
<p>

### 4. Private Link Service

**4.1.** Test access to ***spoke3*** web application using the private endpoint in ***hub1***.

```sh
curl spoke3pls.eu.az.corp
```

<details>

<summary>Sample output</summary>

```json
azureuser@spoke1Vm:~$ curl spoke3pls.eu.az.corp
{
  "Headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Host": "spoke3pls.eu.az.corp",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.68.0"
  },
  "Hostname": "spoke3Vm",
  "Local-IP": "10.3.0.5",
  "Remote-IP": "10.3.6.4"
}
```

</details>
<p>

The `Hostname` and `Local-IP` fields identify the target web server - in this case ***spoke3*** virtual machine. The `Remote-IP` field (as seen by the web server) is an IP address in the Private Link Service NAT subnet in ***spoke3***.

### 5. Private Link Access to Storage Account

A storage account with a container blob deployed and accessible via private endpoints in ***hub1***. The storage accounts have the following naming convention:

* hs11spoke3sa\<AAAA\>.blob.core.windows.net

Where ***\<AAAA\>*** is a randomly generated two-byte string.

**5.1.** On your Cloudshell (or local machine), get the storage account hostname and blob URL.

```sh
spoke3_storage_account=$(az storage account list -g Hs11_HubSpoke_Azfw_1Region_RG --query "[?contains(name, 'hs11spoke3sa')].name" -o tsv)

spoke3_sgtacct_host="$spoke3_storage_account.blob.core.windows.net"
spoke3_blob_url="https://$spoke3_sgtacct_host/spoke3/spoke3.txt"

echo -e "\n$spoke3_sgtacct_host\n" && echo
```

<details>

<summary>Sample output</summary>

```sh
hs11spoke3sa4dd5.blob.core.windows.net
```

</details>
<p>

**5.2.** Resolve the hostname

```sh
nslookup $spoke3_sgtacct_host
```

<details>

<summary>Sample output</summary>

```sh
1-hub-spoke-azfw-single-region$ nslookup $spoke3_sgtacct_host
Server:         8.8.8.8
Address:        8.8.8.8#53

Non-authoritative answer:
hs11spoke3sa4dd5.blob.core.windows.net  canonical name = hs11spoke3sa4dd5.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net.
hs11spoke3sa4dd5.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net      canonical name = blob.db3prdstr20a.store.core.windows.net.
Name:   blob.db3prdstr20a.store.core.windows.net
Address: 20.150.84.164
```

</details>
<p>

We can see that the endpoint is a public IP address, ***20.150.84.164***. We can see the CNAME `hs11spoke3sa4dd5.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net.` created for the storage account which recursively resolves to the public IP address.

**5.3.** Test access to the storage account blob.

```sh
curl $spoke3_blob_url && echo
```

<details>

<summary>Sample output</summary>

```sh
Hello, World!
```

</details>
<p>

### 6. Private Link Access to Storage Account from On-premises

**6.1** Login to on-premises virtual machine `Hs11-branch1Vm` via the [serial console](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/serial-console-overview#access-serial-console-for-virtual-machines-via-azure-portal):
  - username = ***azureuser***
  - password = ***Password123***

 We will test access from `Hs11-branch1Vm` to the storage account for ***spoke3*** via the private endpoint in ***hub1***.

**6.2.** Run `az login` using the VM's system-assigned managed identity.

```sh
az login --identity
```

<details>

<summary>Sample output</summary>

```json
azureuser@branch1Vm:~$ az login --identity
[
  {
    "environmentName": "AzureCloud",
    "homeTenantId": "aaa-bbb-ccc-ddd-eee",
    "id": "xxx-yyy-1234-1234-1234",
    "isDefault": true,
    "managedByTenants": [
      {
        "tenantId": "your-tenant-id"
      }
    ],
    "name": "some-random-name",
    "state": "Enabled",
    "tenantId": "your-tenant-id",
    "user": {
      "assignedIdentityInfo": "MSI",
      "name": "systemAssignedIdentity",
      "type": "servicePrincipal"
    }
  }
]
```

</details>
<p>

**6.3.** Get the storage account hostname and blob URL.

```sh
spoke3_storage_account=$(az storage account list -g Hs11_HubSpoke_Azfw_1Region_RG --query "[?contains(name, 'hs11spoke3sa')].name" -o tsv)

spoke3_sgtacct_host="$spoke3_storage_account.blob.core.windows.net"
spoke3_blob_url="https://$spoke3_sgtacct_host/spoke3/spoke3.txt"

echo -e "\n$spoke3_sgtacct_host\n" && echo
```

<details>

<summary>Sample output</summary>

```sh
hs11spoke3sa4dd5.blob.core.windows.net
```

</details>
<p>

**6.4.** Resolve the storage account DNS name

```sh
nslookup $spoke3_sgtacct_host
```

<details>

<summary>Sample output</summary>

```sh
azureuser@branch1Vm:~$ nslookup $spoke3_sgtacct_host
Server:         127.0.0.53
Address:        127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
hs11spoke3sa4dd5.blob.core.windows.net  canonical name = hs11spoke3sa4dd5.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net.
Name:   hs11spoke3sa4dd5.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net
Address: 10.11.7.99
```

</details>
<p>

We can see that the storage account hostname resolves to the private endpoint ***10.11.7.99*** in ***hub1***. The following is a summary of the DNS resolution from `Hs11-branch1Vm`:

- On-premises server `Hs11-branch1Vm` makes a DNS request for `hs11spoke3sa4dd5.blob.core.windows.net`
- The request is received by on-premises DNS server `Hs11-branch1-dns`
- The DNS server resolves `hs11spoke3sa4dd5.blob.core.windows.net` to the CNAME `hs11spoke3sa4dd5.privatelink.blob.core.windows.net`
- The DNS server has a conditional DNS forwarding defined in the branch1 unbound DNS configuration file, [output/branch1Dns.sh](./output/branch1Dns.sh).

  ```sh
  forward-zone:
          name: "privatelink.blob.core.windows.net."
          forward-addr: 10.11.8.4
  ```

  DNS Requests matching `privatelink.blob.core.windows.net` will be forwarded to the private DNS resolver inbound endpoint in ***hub1*** (10.11.8.4).
- The DNS server forwards the DNS request to the private DNS resolver inbound endpoint in ***hub1*** - which returns the IP address of the storage account private endpoint in ***hub1*** (10.11.7.99)

**6.5.** Test access to the storage account blob.

```sh
curl $spoke3_blob_url && echo
```

<details>

<summary>Sample output</summary>

```sh
Hello, World!
```

</details>
<p>

### 7. Azure Firewall (Optional)

To view firewall logs, set `enable_diagnostics = true` in the [`main.tf`](./02-main.tf). Then run `terraform apply` to update the deployment. Wait for about 15 minutes to get some logs.

<details>

### 8. On-premises Routes

**8.1** Login to on-premises virtual machine `Hs11-branch1Nva` via the [serial console](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/serial-console-overview#access-serial-console-for-virtual-machines-via-azure-portal):
  - username = ***azureuser***
  - password = ***Password123***

**8.2.** Enter the VTY shell for the FRRouting daemon.

```sh
sudo vtysh
```

<details>

## Cleanup

1\. (Optional) Navigate back to the lab directory (if you are not already there)

```sh
cd azure-network-terraform/1-hub-and-spoke/1-hub-spoke-azfw-single-region
```

2\. (Optional) This is not required if `enable_diagnostics = false` in the [`main.tf`](./02-main.tf). If you deployed the lab with `enable_diagnostics = true`, in order to avoid terraform errors when re-deploying this lab, run a cleanup script to remove diagnostic settings that are not removed after the resource group is deleted.

```sh
bash ../../scripts/_cleanup.sh Hs11_HubSpoke_Azfw_1Region_RG
```

```

4\. Delete terraform state files and other generated files.

```sh
rm -rf .terraform*
rm terraform.tfstate*
```
