## Overview

Deploy a single-region Hub and Spoke Secured Virtual Network (Vnet) topology using Azure Firewall for traffic inspection. Learn about traffic routing patterns, [hybrid DNS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-resolver-hybrid-dns) resolution, firewall security policies, and [PrivateLink Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview) access to IaaS, [PrivateLink](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-overview) access to PaaS services.

![Secured Hub and Spoke (Single region)](../../images/scenarios/1-1-hub-spoke-azfw-single-region.png)

***Hub1*** is a Vnet hub that has an Azure firewall used for inspection of traffic between an on-premises branch and Vnet spokes. User-Defined Routes (UDR) are used to influence the hub Vnet data plane to route traffic between the branch and spokes via the firewall. An isolated spoke ***spoke3*** does not have Vnet peering to ***hub1***, but is reachable from the hub via [Private Link Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview).

***Branch1*** is our on-premises network simulated in a Vnet. A Multi-NIC Cisco-CSR-1000V Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) connects to the ***hub1*** using an IPsec VPN connection with dynamic (BGP) routing.

## Prerequisites

## Testing

Each virtual machine is pre-configured with a shell [script](../../scripts/server.sh) to run various types of network reachability tests. Serial console access has been configured for all virtual machines. You can [access the serial console](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/serial-console-overview#access-serial-console-for-virtual-machines-via-azure-portal) of a virtual machine from the Azure portal.

Login to virtual machine `Hs11-spoke1-vm` via the serial console:

- On Azure portal select *Virtual machines*
- Select the virtual machine `Hs11-spoke1-vm`
- Under ***Help*** section, select ***Serial console*** and wait for a login prompt
- Enter the login credentials
  - username = ***azureuser***
  - password = ***Password123***
- You should now be in a shell session `azureuser@Hs11-spoke1-vm:~$`

Run the following tests from inside the serial console session.

### 1. Ping IP

This script pings the IP addresses of some test virtual machines and reports reachability and round trip time.

**1.1.** Run the IP ping test

```sh
ping-ip
```

Sample output

```sh
azureuser@Hs11-spoke1-vm:~$ ping-ip

 ping ip ...

branch1 - 10.10.0.5 -OK 8.303 ms
hub1    - 10.11.0.5 -OK 3.894 ms
spoke1  - 10.1.0.5 -OK 0.033 ms
spoke2  - 10.2.0.5 -OK 5.370 ms
internet - icanhazip.com -NA
```

### 2. Ping DNS

This script pings the DNS name of some test virtual machines and reports reachability and round trip time. This tests hybrid DNS resolution between on-premises and Azure.

**2.1.** Run the DNS ping test

```sh
ping-dns
```

Sample output

```sh
azureuser@Hs11-spoke1-vm:~$ ping-dns

 ping dns ...

vm.branch1.corp - 10.10.0.5 -OK 8.557 ms
vm.hub1.we.az.corp - 10.11.0.5 -OK 4.421 ms
vm.spoke1.we.az.corp - 10.1.0.5 -OK 0.036 ms
vm.spoke2.we.az.corp - 10.2.0.5 -OK 4.949 ms
icanhazip.com - 104.18.114.97 -NA
```

### 3. Curl DNS

This script uses curl to check reachability of the web servers (python Flask) on the test virtual machines. It reports HTTP response message, round trip time and IP address.

**3.1.** Run the DNS curl test

```sh
curl-dns
```

Sample output

```sh
azureuser@Hs11-spoke1-vm:~$ curl-dns

 curl dns ...

200 (0.050933s) - 10.10.0.5 - vm.branch1.corp
200 (0.028826s) - 10.11.0.5 - vm.hub1.we.az.corp
200 (0.017382s) - 10.11.7.4 - spoke3.p.hub1.we.az.corp
200 (0.017226s) - 10.1.0.5 - vm.spoke1.we.az.corp
200 (0.035203s) - 10.2.0.5 - vm.spoke2.we.az.corp
000 (2.001527s) -  - vm.spoke3.we.az.corp
200 (0.015364s) - 104.18.115.97 - icanhazip.com
200 (0.044028s) - 10.11.7.5 - hs11-spoke3-983d.azurewebsites.net
```

We can see that curl test to spoke3 virtual machine `vm.spoke3.we.az.corp` returns a ***000*** HTTP response code. This is expected since there is no Vnet peering from ***spoke3*** to ***hub1***. However, ***spoke3*** web application is reachable via Private Link Service private endpoint in ***hub1*** `spoke3.p.hub1.we.az.corp`.

### 4. Private Link Service

**4.1.** Test access to ***spoke3*** web application using the private endpoint in ***hub1***.

```sh
curl spoke3.p.hub1.we.az.corp
```

Sample output

```sh
azureuser@Hs11-spoke1-vm:~$ curl spoke3.p.hub1.we.az.corp
{
  "Headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Host": "spoke3.p.hub1.we.az.corp",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.68.0"
  },
  "Hostname": "Hs11-spoke3-vm",
  "Local-IP": "10.3.0.5",
  "Remote-IP": "10.3.6.4"
}
```

The `Hostname` and `Local-IP` fields identify the target web server - in this case ***spoke3*** virtual machine. The `Remote-IP` field (as seen by the web server) is an IP address in the Private Link Service NAT subnet in ***spoke3***.

### 5. Private Link (App Service) Access from Public Client

An app service instance is deployed for ***spoke3***. The app service instance is a fully managed PaaS service. In this lab, the service is linked to ***spoke3***. By using [Virtual Network integration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-vnet-integration#regional-virtual-network-integration), the app service is deployed in a dedicated ***AppServiceSubnet*** subnet in ***spoke3***. This allows the app service to access private resources in ***spoke3*** Vnet.

The app service is accessible via the private endpoint in ***hub1***. The app service is also accessible via its public endpoint. The app service application is a simple [python Flask web application](https://hub.docker.com/r/ksalawu/web) that returns the HTTP headers, hostname and IP addresses of the server running the application.

The app service uses the following naming convention:

- hs11-spoke3-AAAA.azurewebsites.net

Where ***AAAA*** is a randomly generated two-byte string.

**5.1.** On your local machine, get the hostname of the app service linked to ***spoke3***

```sh
spoke3_apps_url=$(az webapp list --resource-group Hs11RG --query "[?contains(name, 'hs11-spoke3')].defaultHostName" -o tsv)
```

**5.2.** Display the hostname

```sh
echo $spoke3_apps_url
```

Sample output (yours will be different)

```sh
hs11-spoke3-983d.azurewebsites.net
```

**5.3.** Resolve the hostname

```sh
nslookup $spoke3_apps_url
```

Sample output (yours will be different)

```sh
1-hub-spoke-azfw-single-region$ nslookup $spoke3_apps_url
Server:         172.29.160.1
Address:        172.29.160.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
hs11-spoke3-983d.azurewebsites.net  canonical name = hs11-spoke3-983d-app.privatelink.azurewebsites.net.
hs11-spoke3-983d-app.privatelink.azurewebsites.net      canonical name = waws-prod-am2-551.sip.azurewebsites.windows.net.
waws-prod-am2-551.sip.azurewebsites.windows.net canonical name = waws-prod-am2-551-a8b4.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com.
Name:   waws-prod-am2-551-a8b4.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com
Address: 20.105.224.9
```

We can see that the endpoint is a public IP address, ***20.105.224.9***. We can see the CNAME `hs11-spoke3-983d-app.privatelink.azurewebsites.net` created for the app service which recursively resolves to the public IP address.

**5.4.** Test access to the ***spoke3*** app service via the public endpoint.

```sh
curl $spoke3_apps_url
```

Sample output

```sh
1-hub-spoke-azfw-single-region$ curl $spoke3_apps_url
{
  "Headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Client-Ip": "140.228.48.45:29444",
    "Disguised-Host": "hs11-spoke3-983d.azurewebsites.net",
    "Host": "hs11-spoke3-983d.azurewebsites.net",
    "Max-Forwards": "10",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.74.0",
    "Was-Default-Hostname": "hs11-spoke3-983d.azurewebsites.net",
    "X-Arr-Log-Id": "74ac0989-87dd-4446-8226-0e3f6bed3aba",
    "X-Client-Ip": "140.228.48.45",
    "X-Client-Port": "29444",
    "X-Forwarded-For": "140.228.48.45:29444",
    "X-Original-Url": "/",
    "X-Site-Deployment-Id": "hs11-spoke3-983d-app",
    "X-Waws-Unencoded-Url": "/"
  },
  "Hostname": "48961308218d",
  "Local-IP": "169.254.129.3",
  "Remote-IP": "169.254.129.1"
}
```

Observe that we are connecting from our local client's public IP address specified in the `X-Client-Ip`.

**(Optional)** Repeat *Step 5.1* through *Step 5.4* for the app service linked to ***spoke6***.

### 6. Private Link (App Service) Access from On-premises

**6.1** Recall the hostname of the app service in ***spoke3*** as done in *Step 5.2*. In this lab deployment, the hostname is `hs11-spoke3-983d.azurewebsites.net`.

**6.2.** Connect to the on-premises server `Hs11-branch1-vm` [using the serial console](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/serial-console-overview#access-serial-console-for-virtual-machines-via-azure-portal). We will test access from `Hs11-branch1-vm` to the app service for ***spoke3*** via the private endpoint in ***hub1***.

**6.3.** Resolve the hostname DNS - which is `hs11-spoke3-983d.azurewebsites.net` in this example. Use your actual hostname from *Step 6.1*.

```sh
nslookup hs11-spoke3-<AAAA>.azurewebsites.net
```

Sample output

```sh
azureuser@Hs11-branch1-vm:~$ nslookup hs11-spoke3-983d.azurewebsites.net
Server:         127.0.0.53
Address:        127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
hs11-spoke3-983d.azurewebsites.net  canonical name = hs11-spoke3-983d-app.privatelink.azurewebsites.net.
Name:   hs11-spoke3-983d-app.privatelink.azurewebsites.net
Address: 10.11.7.5
```

We can see that the app service hostname resolves to the private endpoint ***10.11.7.5*** in ***hub1***. The following is a summary of the DNS resolution from `Hs11-branch1-vm`:

- On-premises server `Hs11-branch1-vm` makes a DNS request for `hs11-spoke3-983d.azurewebsites.net`
- The request is received by on-premises DNS server `Hs11-branch1-dns`
- The DNS server resolves `hs11-spoke3-983d.azurewebsites.net` to the CNAME `hs11-spoke3-983d-app.privatelink.azurewebsites.net`
- The DNS server has a conditional DNS forwarding defined in the [unbound DNS configuration file](./output/branch-unbound.sh).

  ```sh
  forward-zone:
          name: "privatelink.azurewebsites.net."
          forward-addr: 10.11.8.4
  ```

  DNS Requests matching `privatelink.azurewebsites.net` will be forwarded to the private DNS resolver inbound endpoint in ***hub1*** (10.11.8.4).
- The DNS server forwards the DNS request to the private DNS resolver inbound endpoint in ***hub1*** - which returns the IP address of the app service private endpoint in ***hub1*** (10.11.7.5)

**6.4.** From `Hs11-branch1-vm`, test access to the ***spoke3*** app service via the private endpoint. Use your actual hostname.

```sh
curl hs11-spoke3-<AAAA>.azurewebsites.net
```

Sample output

```sh
azureuser@Hs11-branch1-vm:~$ curl hs11-spoke3-983d.azurewebsites.net
{
  "Headers": {
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Client-Ip": "[fd40:de3d:12:8cd8:6a12:100:a0a:5]:39466",
    "Disguised-Host": "hs11-spoke3-983d.azurewebsites.net",
    "Host": "hs11-spoke3-983d.azurewebsites.net",
    "Max-Forwards": "10",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.68.0",
    "Was-Default-Hostname": "hs11-spoke3-983d.azurewebsites.net",
    "X-Arr-Log-Id": "9f782a62-f8b9-4824-94d3-bb1bbe6c4358",
    "X-Client-Ip": "10.10.0.5",
    "X-Client-Port": "0",
    "X-Forwarded-For": "10.10.0.5",
    "X-Original-Url": "/",
    "X-Site-Deployment-Id": "hs11-spoke3-983d-app",
    "X-Waws-Unencoded-Url": "/"
  },
  "Hostname": "48961308218d",
  "Local-IP": "169.254.129.3",
  "Remote-IP": "169.254.129.1"
}
```

Observe that we are connecting from the private IP address of `Hs11-branch1-vm` (10.10.0.5) specified in the `X-Client-Ip`.

### 7. On-premises Routes

Login to the onprem router `Hs11-branch1-nva` in order to observe its dynamic routes.

**7.1.** Login to virtual machine `Hs11-branch1-nva` via the [serial console](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/serial-console-overview#access-serial-console-for-virtual-machines-via-azure-portal).

**7.2.** Enter username and password

   - username = ***azureuser***
   - password = ***Password123***

**7.3.** Enter the Cisco enable mode

```sh
enable
```

**7.4.** Display the routing table by typing `show ip route` and pressing the space bar to show the complete output.

```sh
show ip route
```

Sample output

```sh
Hs11-branch1-nva-vm#show ip route

## Cleanup

1. (Optional) Navigate back to the lab directory (if you are not already there)

   ```sh
   cd azure-network-terraform/1-hub-and-spoke/1-hub-spoke-azfw-single-region
   ```

2. In order to avoid terraform errors when re-deploying this lab, run a cleanup script to remove diagnostic settings that may not be removed after the resource group is deleted.

   ```sh
   bash ../../scripts/_cleanup.sh Hs11
   ```

   Sample output

   ```sh
   1-hub-spoke-azfw-single-region$    bash ../../scripts/_cleanup.sh Hs11

   Resource group: Hs11RG

   ⏳ Checking for diagnostic settings on resources in Hs11RG ...

   ```

3. Delete the resource group to remove all resources installed.

   ```sh
   az group delete -g Hs11RG --no-wait
   ```

4. Delete terraform state files and other generated files.

   ```sh
   rm -rf .terraform*
   rm terraform.tfstate*
   ```
