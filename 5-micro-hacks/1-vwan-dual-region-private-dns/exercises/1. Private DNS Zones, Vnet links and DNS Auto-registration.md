## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have deployed the base infrastructure using terraform as described in [*Private DNS in Virtual WAN*](../README.md#prerequisites). All configuration in this exercise is deployed on top of the base infrastructure.

## Overview

In this exercise we will create private DNS zones for each spoke and link them to virtual networks. We will also enable private DNS zone auto-registration for the spoke virtual networks.

![mh51-1-private-dns-zones-links-config](../../images/../../images/microhacks/mh51/mh51-1-private-dns-zones-links-config.png)

⚙️ Configuration summary:

<ol type="A">
  <li>Create a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-getstarted-cli">Private DNS Zone</a> owned by the spoke VNet owners. E.g. Owners of Spoke1 VNet own the DNS zone ***spoke1.eu.az.corp***. The same applies to other spokes. This is just an assumption for our use case. Customer requirements may vary.</li>
  <li>Create a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-autoregistration">Vnet link (with auto-registration)</a> from each spoke Vnet to the corresponding private DNS zone. The Vnet link allows resources in a Vnet to resolve all records in the zone. Auto-registration automatically creates DNS records in the zone when VMs are created in the spoke.</li>
  <li>Create a Vnet link (no auto-registration) from each regional Shared Services Vnet to all private DNS zones hosting records for Vnets in same region. The Vnet link allows VMs and resources in the Shared Services Vnet to resolve all DNS zone records.</li>
</ol>

Let's proceed with the configuration.

## Task 1: Create Private DNS zones

A [private DNS zone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-privatednszone) is used to host the private DNS records for a particular domain. Each DNS record for your domain is created inside this DNS zone.

⚙️ **1\.** Save the environment variables

```bash
export PREFIX=Vwan_Dns
export RG_NAME=${PREFIX}RG
```

⚙️ **2\.** Create the private DNS zones.

```bash
az network private-dns zone create -g $RG_NAME -n spoke1.eu.az.corp
az network private-dns zone create -g $RG_NAME -n spoke2.eu.az.corp
az network private-dns zone create -g $RG_NAME -n spoke3.us.az.corp
az network private-dns zone create -g $RG_NAME -n spoke4.us.az.corp
```

⚙️ **3\.** Navigate through the Azure portal to verify the created private DNS zones.

## Task 2: Create VNet links and enable DNS auto-registration

To publish a private DNS zone to your virtual network, you specify the list of virtual networks that are allowed to resolve records within the zone. This is done by creating a [virtual network link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-autoregistration) between the DNS zone and the virtual network.

The DNS private zone [auto registration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-autoregistration) feature manages DNS records for virtual machines deployed in a virtual network. When you link a virtual network with a private DNS zone with auto-registration enabled, a DNS record is created for each virtual machine deployed in the virtual network.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Private DNS zones are resilient [global resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-resiliency). Records in the zones can be resolved from any VNet in any region. In our scenario, the VNet links have a regional scope. E.g. ***region1*** (northeurope) VNets are linked to ***eu.az.corp*** zones, and ***region2*** (eastus) VNets are linked to ***us.az.corp*** zones. Customer requirements may vary.

⚙️ **1\.** Create VNet links with auto-registration from each private DNS zone to its corresponding spoke VNet.

```bash
COMMAND="az network private-dns link vnet create -g $RG_NAME -e true"
$COMMAND -n spoke1-vnet-link -z spoke1.eu.az.corp -v "${PREFIX}-spoke1-vnet"
$COMMAND -n spoke2-vnet-link -z spoke2.eu.az.corp -v "${PREFIX}-spoke2-vnet"
$COMMAND -n spoke3-vnet-link -z spoke3.us.az.corp -v "${PREFIX}-spoke3-vnet"
$COMMAND -n spoke4-vnet-link -z spoke4.us.az.corp -v "${PREFIX}-spoke4-vnet"
```

⚙️ **2\.** Create VNet links from each private DNS zone to **region1** shared services VNet.

```bash
COMMAND="az network private-dns link vnet create -g $RG_NAME -e false"
$COMMAND -n shared1-spoke1-vnet-link -z spoke1.eu.az.corp -v "${PREFIX}-shared1-vnet"
$COMMAND -n shared1-spoke2-vnet-link -z spoke2.eu.az.corp -v "${PREFIX}-shared1-vnet"
```

⚙️ **3\.** Create VNet links from each private DNS zone to **region2** shared services VNet.

```bash
COMMAND="az network private-dns link vnet create -g $RG_NAME -e false"
$COMMAND -n shared2-spoke3-vnet-link -z spoke3.us.az.corp -v "${PREFIX}-shared2-vnet"
$COMMAND -n shared2-spoke4-vnet-link -z spoke4.us.az.corp -v "${PREFIX}-shared2-vnet"
```

⚙️ **4\.** Verify the created private DNS zones.

```bash
echo && az network private-dns zone list -g $RG_NAME -o table \
--query "[].{ZoneName:name, \
RecordSets: numberOfRecordSets, \
VNetLinks: numberOfVirtualNetworkLinks, \
AutoRegistrationLinks: numberOfVirtualNetworkLinksWithRegistration}" && echo
```

Expected output:

```bash
ZoneName           RecordSets    VNetLinks    AutoRegistrationLinks
-----------------  ------------  -----------  -----------------------
spoke1.eu.az.corp  2             2            1
spoke2.eu.az.corp  2             2            1
spoke3.us.az.corp  2             2            1
spoke4.us.az.corp  2             2            1
```

⚙️ **5\.** Verify the VNet links for private DNS zone `spoke1.eu.az.corp`.

```bash
echo && az network private-dns link vnet list -g $RG_NAME -o table -z spoke1.eu.az.corp \
--query "[].{ZoneName:privateZoneName, \
VNetName:virtualNetworkLink.vnet.id, \
VNetLinkName:name, \
AutoRegistration:registrationEnabled}" && echo
```

Expected output:

```bash
VNetLinkName              AutoRegistration
------------------------  ------------------
shared1-spoke1-vnet-link  False
spoke1-vnet-link          True
```

⚙️ **6\.** Navigate through the Azure portal to verify all the private DNS zones and VNet links.

## Task 3: Test DNS Resolution in Spoke1

We will now test DNS resolution to the following destinations from the `Vwan_Dns-spoke1-vm` VM:
* `vm.spoke1.eu.az.corp`
* `vm.spoke2.eu.az.corp`

![mh51-1-private-dns-zones-links-test](../../images/../../images/microhacks/mh51/mh51-1-private-dns-zones-links-test.png)

🔍 DNS query process for ***vm.spoke1.eu.az.corp***:

1. Spoke1 VM’s Vnet is configured to use the default (Azure-provided) DNS servers for all DNS resolution.
2. All private DNS zones linked to the VM’s VNet are checked for DNS suffix match. A match is found in zone ***spoke1.eu.az.corp*** and the record for ***vm.spoke1.eu.az.corp*** is returned to the VM.

🔍 DNS query process for ***vm.spoke2.eu.az.corp***:
1. Spoke1 VM’s Vnet is configured to use the default (Azure-provided) DNS servers for all DNS resolution.
2. All private DNS zones linked to the VM’s VNet are checked for DNS suffix match. No match is found. NXDOMAIN response is eventually returned to the VM.

Learn more about [DNS query process when using an Azure DNS Private Resolver](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-private-resolver-overview#how-does-it-work).

Let's run some tests.

⚙️ **1\.** Verify that the VNet of `Vwan_Dns-spoke1-vm` has no custom DNS servers configured; which confirms that the VNet will use the Azure DNS servers for all DNS resolution.

```bash
az network vnet show -g $RG_NAME -n ${PREFIX}-spoke1-vnet --query "dhcpOptions.dnsServers"
```
Expected output:

```bash
[]
```

⚙️ **2\.** Login to the ***spoke1*** virtual machine `Vwan_Dns-spoke1-vm` via the [serial console](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/virtual-machines/serial-console-overview#access-serial-console-for-virtual-machines-via-azure-portal):
* username = ***azureuser***
* password = ***Password123***

You should now be in a shell terminal session `azureuser@vm:~$` where we will run the following tests.

> **Note:** Each virtual machine is pre-configured with [scripts](../../../scripts/server.sh) to run various types of network reachability tests including DNS resolution.

⚙️ **3\.** Run a DNS lookup for the private DNS zone `spoke1.eu.az.corp`

```bash
nslookup vm.spoke1.eu.az.corp
```

Sample output:

```bash
azureuser@vm:~$ nslookup vm.spoke1.eu.az.corp
Server:         127.0.0.53
Address:        127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   vm.spoke1.eu.az.corp
Address: 10.1.0.5
```

⚙️ **4\.** Run a DNS lookup for the private DNS zone `spoke2.eu.az.corp`

```bash
nslookup vm.spoke2.eu.az.corp
```
Sample output:

```bash
azureuser@vm:~$ nslookup vm.spoke2.eu.az.corp
Server:         127.0.0.53
Address:        127.0.0.53#53

** server can't find vm.spoke2.eu.az.corp: NXDOMAIN
```

⚙️ **5\.** Run a DNS lookup for `vm.branch1.corp` which is a DNS record in the on-premises DNS server.

```bash
nslookup vm.branch1.corp
```

Sample output:

```bash
azureuser@vm:~$ nslookup vm.branch1.corp
Server:         127.0.0.53
Address:        127.0.0.53#53

** server can't find vm.branch1.corp: NXDOMAIN
 ```

The `NXDOMAIN` errors are expected. The ***spoke1*** VM can only resolve DNS names in the private DNS zone `spoke1.eu.az.corp` because its VNet is linked to the zone. It cannot resolve records in other private DNS zones or on-premises.

⚙️ **6\.** Run the `ping-dns` test script to check DNS resolution to all virtual machines.

```bash
ping-dns
```

Sample output:

```bash
azureuser@vm:~$ ping-dns

 ping dns ...

vm.branch1.corp -  -NA
vm.spoke1.eu.az.corp - 10.1.0.5 -OK 0.039 ms
vm.spoke2.eu.az.corp -  -NA
vm.branch2.corp -  -NA
vm.spoke3.us.az.corp -  -NA
vm.spoke4.us.az.corp -  -NA
icanhazip.com - 104.18.114.97 -NA
```
The output confirms that `Vwan_Dns-spoke1-vm` can only resolve DNS names in DNS zone `spoke1.eu.az.corp` and public DNS names (e.g. icanhazip.com) via the Azure DNS service. All other DNS names are not resolvable.

## Review

You have created private DNS zones for each spoke and linked them to virtual networks. You have also enabled DNS auto-registration for virtual networks.
